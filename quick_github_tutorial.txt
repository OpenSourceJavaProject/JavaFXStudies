********** first time installation **********

1. Download and install GitHub to your computer (github.com)

2. If you use Windows, to run GitHub commands, use Git Shell

3. open Git Shell application, you are under GitHub folder

4. go online to our JavaFXStudies folder, where you were added as a team member
https://github.com/OpenSourceJavaProject/JavaFXStudies/tree/teamwork

5. click on Clone or download link on the righthand side

6. copy the github address;
https://github.com/OpenSourceJavaProject/JavaFXStudies.git

7. go to your Git Shell and type;
git clone https://github.com/OpenSourceJavaProject/JavaFXStudies.git

8. check the folder structure created. you should have JavaFXStudies folder. Go inside that folder typing;
cd JavaFXStudies

9. type ls -al to see all files listed here;
.git
README.md

10. type git status to see the status of the repo, including the branch name. you should see a similar output;
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

nothing to commit, working directory clean

11. now, switch to branch teamwork by typing
git checkout teamwork

the output should be;
Branch teamwork set up to track remote branch teamwork from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'teamwork

12. check the configuration by typing;
git config -l

output should be similar to;
user.email=muratagenc@gmail.com
user.name=Murat Ahmet Genc
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=false
core.bare=false
core.logallrefupdates=true
remote.origin.url=https://github.com/OpenSourceJavaProject/JavaFXStudies.git
remote.origin.fetch=+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
branch.master.remote=origin
branch.master.merge=refs/heads/master
branch.teamwork.remote=origin
branch.teamwork.merge=refs/heads/teamwork

13. IF your email and name is not set, use the following two commands to add your email and name.
 
git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
git config --global user.email "your_email@youremail.com"

14. Now you have completed your github configuration. congratulations.


********** how to update REMOTE repo **********

when you modify a file or add a new one, you need to update the repo. your local repo should be synchronized with the remote repo.

1. for your JavaFX project files, create a new folder with your initials;
an example for me would be muratagenc

2. now you have one folder. go into the folder using cd command. in my case, it would be;
cd muratagenc

3. create a new file named test.txt. you can create the file using Notepad, Wordpad or Word.

4. now, you will use the branch called teamwork, and update the repository. to do that, first switch to the branch teamwork;
git checkout teamwork

5. type the following command to add your changes;
git add *

6. and type the following command;
git commit -m "first test on JavaFxStudies, branch teamwork"

you should receive a similar output:

[teamwork 29bfde8] first test on JavaFxStudies, branch teamwork
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 muratagenc/test.txt

7. finally, you can now push your changes and update the repository.
git push

type your username and password. you should get a similar output;

Counting objects: 6, done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 361 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/OpenSourceJavaProject/JavaFXStudies.git
   2f32a72..3526b12  teamwork -> teamwork

8. IF there is a change on the repo, you won't be able to commit your changes. so type,
git pull
to receive latest repo changes, then;
git push


********** how to update LOCAL repo **********

1. since other team members will update remote repo time to time,
you should get the latest copy too. to do that, type;
git pull

the output may show that some files were updated, or your local repo is already up-to-date.
